<p style="font: italic">this is my first html class.I have been able to learn about  tags the class was
intresting.</p>
<hr>

<p style="font: italic">today we started our class some minutes late  due to some students came late</p>
<h3 style="color: red">about the institution</h3>
<p style="font-size: large"> emobilis is an institution which train students about software development. the institution is located at westlands nairobi. intakes for institution january intake,may intake and also september intake.</p>
<p style="font-size: large">we hope to have the good and realiable programmers at the end of this four months stay

<h4 style="font-size: large"> history of computer</h4>
<p> One of the earliest and most well-known devices was an abacus. Then in 1822, the father of computers, Charles Babbage began developing what would be the first mechanical computer. And then in 1833 he actually designed an Analytical Engine which was a general-purpose computer.</p>

<h5 style="font-size: larger">about software development</h5>
<p>Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software. Software itself is the set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do. It is independent of hardware and makes computers programmable.
The history of software and its development can be traced to the early nineteenth century. All computer systems are designed to utilize the "stored program concept" as first developed by Charles Babbage in the 1850s. The concept was lost until the mid-1940s, when modern computers made their appearance.</p>
<h6 style="color: chartreuse">4th generation</h6>
<p>Fourth Generation of computers was between 1971 – 1980. These computers used the VLSI technology or the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology. Therefore they were also known as the microprocessors. Intel was the first company to develop a microprocessor.</p>

<h7>The generation of computers
1st generation</h7>
<p>The period of first generation was from 1946-1959. The computers of first generation used vacuum tubes as the basic components for memory and circuitry for CPU (Central Processing Unit). These tubes, like electric bulbs, produced a lot of heat and the installations used to fuse frequently.</p>
<h8>2nd generation</h8>
<p>A second-generation computer, through the late 1950s and 1960s featured circuit boards filled with individual transistors and magnetic core memory. These machines remained the mainstream design into the late 1960s, when integrated circuits started appearing and led to the third-generation compute</p>
<h>3rd generation</h>
<p>The third generation computer was started in 1965 and ended around 1971. Third generation computers start using integrated circuits instead of transistors. The integrated circuit (IC) is a semiconductor material, that contains thousands of transistors miniaturized in it.13 Oct 2021</p>
<h>5th generation</h>
<p>Fourth Generation of computers was between 1971 – 1980. These computers used the VLSI technology or the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) circuits technology. Therefore they were also known as the microprocessors. Intel was the first company to develop a microprocessor.</p>
